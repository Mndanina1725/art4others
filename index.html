    <h3>Angelena Wu</h3>
    <h4>Co-Founder</h4>

    <p>Angelena grew up in Regina, Saskatchewan and is currently a second-year Health Studies student at the University
      of Saskatchewan. Passionate about mental health advocacy, Angelena started Art for Others to inspire through creative
      expression. When she’s not studying, you’ll probably find her painting, hitting the gym with friends or rock climbing
      (which mostly involves her trying not to fall off the wall). </p>

    <h3>Martin Ugwu</h3>
    <h4>Co-Founder</h4>

    <p>Growing up in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Martin aims to launch and expand Art4Others in his hometown as an inaugural
      member. One of his goals and aspirations is to one day contribute to changing the world for the better (and to one
      day bench 315 pounds). As a third-year kinesiology student at the University of Saskatchewan, Martin spends most
      of his free time either joking around and making memories with friends or staying active either by playing sports
      or hitting the gym. </p>

    </div>
    <p>Having spent most of her life in Saskatoon, Azaria is excited to connect with the community and make a difference
      through the power of art. As an artist, Azaria’s favorite mediums are watercolor and beadwork, both of which have
      played a significant role in her journey of self-identity. Her connection to art has fostered a sense of belonging
      and a positive community that she hopes to share with others. Additionally, Azaria’s work with beadwork has enabled
      her to raise awareness and funds for causes close to her heart. </p>
