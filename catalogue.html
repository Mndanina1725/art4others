  <h2>Our Catalogue</h2>

  <div id="event1" class="event-section">
    <h3>Youth programs</h3>
    <p>Art4Others has collaborated with the Regina Public Libraries to host visual art programs for elementary-age students!
      There, our volunteers were able to foster peer-mentor relationships, while engaging in creativity! </p>

    <h3>Senior care and rehabilitation programs</h3>
    <p>Our team’s partnership with the Saskatchewan Health Authority has allowed us to host programs at the Wascana
      Rehabilitation Centre, in Regina. There, many of the residents who may experience a disconnect from the outside world,
      made many meaningful memories with our volunteers! </p>

    <h3>Canada day fundraiser</h3>
    <p>100% of the profits made at our face painting stand was put towards Saskatoon’s local women’s shelter, the YWCA!
      These funds allowed our team to purchase and donate various essential products such as blankets, warm clothes,
      hygiene products...etc. There are so many ways in which art brings communities together! </p>
